# 🕸️ SpiderGallery — Connecting Artists & Galleries Through AI

**SpiderGallery** is an experimental **Python-based AI tool** designed to connect **artists** with **galleries** that match their **style**, **medium**, and **vision**.
It gathers information about galleries and uses **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **AI-powered analysis** to suggest meaningful connections — weaving a network of art, data, and creativity.

---

## 🎨 Vision

As an **artist and graphic designer**, I wanted to create something that represents both my **creative roots** and my growing passion for **technology**.
SpiderGallery is my first programming project — a bridge between **art** and **AI** — showing how code can also be a form of expression and storytelling.

> “Every connection is a thread — together they form the web of creativity.”

## 🧠 What SpiderGallery Does

1. **Gathers gallery information**

   * Uses APIs, web scraping, and AI summarization to collect details about galleries:
     *location*, *artists represented*, *style focus*, and *exhibition history*.

2. **Analyzes artist profiles**

   * Artists provide information about their style, portfolio, and interests.
   * LLMs process and categorize their creative profile.

3. **Matches artists with galleries**

   * The AI compares text-based and (future) visual features to find meaningful alignments.
   * Recommendations are based on artistic compatibility, geography, and curatorial direction.

## 💡 Inspiration

SpiderGallery grew from a simple curiosity:

> “What if AI could help artists find the right stage for their work?”

It’s both a **learning journey in programming** and a **creative experiment** — exploring how technology can enhance artistic discovery instead of replacing it.

## 📸 About the Creator

Hi! I’m an **artist and graphic designer** exploring how **AI and code** can serve creativity rather than compete with it.
**SpiderGallery** is my first programming project — a living portfolio piece and exploration into creative technology.

## 🕷️ Optional Banner Idea

If you want to make the README visually stand out, you could add a simple banner at the top like:

```markdown
![SpiderGallery Banner](banner.png)
```

and design a minimal web-like image or typographic logo that ties your **artistic identity** to your new **AI project**.

---

Would you like me to **design a custom banner concept** (e.g., describe the layout/colors/fonts) so you can create it visually — or generate one for you to use in the README?
